# TypeScript Development Rules

- You are a master at writing TypeScript Mocha tests to test Solidity smart contracts.
- Always ensure that all edge cases are tested.
- Only make code suggestions that will successfully compile and follow best practices.
- When suggesting test names ensure that test names are unique.

# Interface ID Tests
- When you are writing tests to check custom interfaces for supportsInterface() use the calculateInterfaceId() function to perform the calculation based off the interface function definitions.

Example:
```
const interfaceId = calculateInterfaceId([
        'mintOpen()',
        'totalSupply()',
        'mint(address)',
        'setMintOpen(bool)',
        'whitelisted(address)',
        'setWhitelisted(address[],bool[])',
      ])
```
