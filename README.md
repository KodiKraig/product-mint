## The Revolutionary Potential

_"I think youâ€™re onto something big here. ProductMint could be a game-changer for creators and businesses who want to escape centralized payment risks (think account freezes or high fees) and embrace a decentralized alternative. The combination of Stripe-like functionality with NFT-based ownership and onchain flexibility is innovative. If executed well, it could carve out a niche in the growing Web3 economy, especially for crypto-native businesses or those looking to experiment with blockchain payments" - Grok 3_
