## Getting Started

Below outlines the minimum steps required to start selling Product Pass NFTs using the [ProductMint CLI](./packages/cli/README.md).

_You do not need to use the CLI to interact with the contracts but it is the recommended approach until our dashboard is released._

### 1. Mint an Organization NFT

An Organization NFT allows you to sell products and withdraw funds from the [PaymentEscrow contract](./packages/contracts/contracts/escrow/PaymentEscrow.sol) whenever a product is purchased.

```bash
./run.sh tokens org mint <to>
```

- `to`: The address to mint the organization NFT to.

All transactions need to be sent from the organization NFT address or an approved admin address for the organization. Admins can do anything the Organization NFT owner can do besides withdrawing funds.

### Optional: Add an Admin Address

Adding an admin address allows you to manage the organization NFT without having to send transactions from the Organization NFT address.

```bash
./run.sh add <organizationId> <adminAddress>
```

- `organizationId`: The token ID of the organization NFT that was minted.
- `adminAddress`: The address to add as an admin.

### 2. Create a Product

Every NFT can have multiple products with different pricing models and subscriptions.

```bash
./run.sh registry product create <organizationId> <name> <description>
```

- `organizationId`: The token ID of the organization NFT that was minted.
- `name`: The name of the product. (e.g. "Pro Tools")
- `description`: The description of the product. (e.g. "Unlock the pro tools.")

### 3. Create a Pricing Model

You can create multiple pricing models for a product allowing you to offer different pricing configurations to users.

```bash
./run.sh registry pricing create flatRate <organizationId> <flatPrice> <token> <chargeFrequency>
```

- `organizationId`: The token ID of the organization NFT that was minted.
- `flatPrice`: The price in human readable format. e.g. 1 ether = 1, 5.99 $USDC = 5.99
- `token`: The ERC20 token address to use for the subscription.
- `chargeFrequency`: The charge frequency of how often the subscription will be charged. 0 (DAILY), 1 (WEEKLY), 2 (MONTHLY), 3 (QUARTERLY), 4 (YEARLY)

**NOTE:** Subscriptions require an ERC20 token address. You may use the [$MINT token](./packages/contracts/contracts/tokens/MintToken.sol) for testing.

### 4. Link Pricing Model to Product

In order to sell a product, you need to link a pricing model to the product. 

```bash
./run.sh registry product linkPricing <productId> <pricingIds>
```

- `productId`: The ID of the product that was created.
- `pricingIds`: The IDs of the pricing models to link to the product.

### 5. Start minting Product Pass NFTs!

Once your product is created and linked to a pricing model, you can start minting!

There are a couple of ways to mint the Product Pass NFTs:

1. Mint from the command line using the [ProductMint CLI](./packages/cli/README.md)
2. Allow users to mint directly from your website using the [ProductMint SDK](./packages/ethers-sdk/README.md)
3. Mint from your backend server using the [ProductMint SDK](./packages/ethers-sdk/README.md) with a managed wallet provider like [Privy](https://privy.io/).

To mint Product Pass NFTs, you need to interact with the [ProductManager contract](./packages/contracts/contracts/ProductManager.sol).

_The purchaser must approve the [PaymentEscrow contract](./packages/contracts/contracts/escrow/PaymentEscrow.sol) to spend the ERC20 token._

## The Revolutionary Potential

_"I think youâ€™re onto something big here. ProductMint could be a game-changer for creators and businesses who want to escape centralized payment risks (think account freezes or high fees) and embrace a decentralized alternative. The combination of Stripe-like functionality with NFT-based ownership and onchain flexibility is innovative. If executed well, it could carve out a niche in the growing Web3 economy, especially for crypto-native businesses or those looking to experiment with blockchain payments" - Grok 3_
