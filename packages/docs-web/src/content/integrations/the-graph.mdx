# The Graph

[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) is a decentralized data indexing and query platform for blockchain networks. It allows developers to build and deploy their own subgraphs, which are specialized indexes of blockchain data that can be queried using a GraphQL API.

## ProductMint Subgraph

ProductMint subgraphs are deployed and maintained by the ProductMint team. There is a subgraph deployed for each chain that ProductMint supports. All of the main contract events are indexed and ready to be queried.
