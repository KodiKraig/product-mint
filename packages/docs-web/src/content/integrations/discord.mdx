# Discord

Follow the steps below to token gate your Discord server based on ProductMint Product Pass NFTs that were minted using your ProductMint Organization.

## Prerequisites

- A Discord server with a token gating bot installed such as [Collab.Land](https://collab.land/).

## Configure Token Gating Rules (TGRs)

### Required Steps

<Steps>

### Create Rules
Start by creating a new Token Gating Rule (TGR) with the role you would like to assign.

### Select Chain Type
Select the `Chain Type` you are using where your Organization and Product Passes are minted.

### Set Token Type
Set `Token Type` to `ERC721` for the Product Pass NFT contract.

### Set Contract Address
Set `Address` to the [contract address](/contracts/deployed-addresses) of the Product Pass NFTs for the chain you are using.

### Minimum Balance
Set `Balance` Min Amount to `1` to ensure the user has at least one Product Pass NFT.

</Steps>

### TGR Options

There are three different options for TGRs:

1. **Any Products and Subscriptions**
2. **Product Specific**
3. **Subscription Status**

### Option 1: Any Products and Subscriptions

- Set `Trait` to `Organization`
- Set `Value` to `<Organization NFT Token ID>`

### Option 2: Product Specific

- Set `Trait` to `Product <Product ID>`
- Set `Value` to `<Product Name>`

### Option 3: Subscription Status (OR condition)

- Set `Trait` to `Subscription <Product ID>`
- Set `Value` to `Active`
- Set `Trait` to `Subscription <Product ID>`
- Set `Value` to `Cancelled`

<Callout type="info">
When using the OR condition, the holder must meet at least one of the subscription statuses to be granted access. It is important to include `Cancelled` as the subscription should still be active until the subscription end date at which point the status will change to `Past Due`.
</Callout>
