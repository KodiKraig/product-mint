# Payment Escrow

The Payment Escrow contract is used to hold funds for an organization.

Fees are collected on each transaction when a Product Pass is minted or a subscription is renewed or upgraded.

**NOTE:** This is the only cost to use the ProductMint system paid only when you get paid.

## Fees

Fees are collected on each transaction when a Product Pass NFT is used to purchase a product or a subscription is renewed/upgraded.

### Fees by Chain

Each chain has a different fee structure for the Payment Escrow contract along with different fee percentage based on token characteristics such as stablecoin, market cap, etc.

### Layer 1 vs Layer 2

Layer 1 chains have a higher fee structure than Layer 2 chains. This is because Layer 1 chains have a higher gas price and are more expensive to use and operate our system.

### Stablecoins

Stablecoins such as USDC have a lower fee structure than non-stablecoins. This is because stablecoins prices do not change.
