    - **Tiered**: Quantity based, paid at start of billing cycle similar to "seats" for SaaS services.
    - **Usage**: Metered and paid at the end of billing cycle. Useful for services that are metered like data usage, API calls, AI tokens, etc.

## Charge Frequencies

Subscription billing cycles can use the following durations:
- Daily (24 hours)
- Weekly (7 days)
- Monthly (30 days)
