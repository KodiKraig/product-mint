# Renewal Processor

The renewal processor is responsible for processing renewals for subscriptions. When a subscription is up for renewal, ProductMint will submit a renewal transaction to the Renewal Processor.

- Renewals are processed even if the subscription is cannot renew emitting a `RenewalProcessed` event
- The `RenewalProcessed` event will contain the status of the subscription renewal

## Renewal Status

```solidity
/**
 * @dev SUCCESS: The renewal was successful.
 * @dev FAILED: The renewal failed.
 * @dev NOT_READY: The renewal is not ready to be processed.
 * @dev CANCELLED: The subscription was cancelled.
 * @dev PAUSED: The subscription was paused.
 * @dev READY: The renewal is ready to be processed.
 */
enum RenewalStatus {
    SUCCESS,
    FAILED,
    NOT_READY,
    CANCELLED,
    PAUSED,
    READY
}
```

## Renewal Processed Event

```solidity
/**
 * @param orgId The organization ID of the subscription.
 * @param productPassId The product pass ID of the subscription.
 * @param productId The product ID of the subscription.
 * @param status The status of the renewal process.

event RenewalProcessed(
