# NFTs

ProductMint uses NFTs to represent ownership for both the business (organization) and the customer (product pass). All metadata is onchain and configurable by the organization.

## Organization NFT

Used to represent the business that is selling products and crypto subscriptions. 

- Transferable 
- Free to mint
- Required to create products and pricing models

<Callout type="warning">
Only the wallet that holds the Organization NFT has the ability to withdraw revenue from the payment escrow contract. If you lose access to the wallet that holds the Organization NFT, you will not be able to withdraw your revenue.

## Product Pass NFT

A product pass is minted to a user when they purchase product(s) from an organization using the ProductMint system.

- Only transferable if all products on the pass are transferable and all subscriptions are paused
- Must purchase products from an organization to mint
- Additional products can be added to the pass after mint

## Metadata

Metadata providers are responsible for returning a base64 encoded JSON string for each token. Both the Organization and Product Pass NFTs have their own metadata providers.

- Metadata conforms to the [OpenSea ERC721 standard](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards)
- Each organization can set their own metadata for their NFTs

```solidity
/**
 * @param name The name of the token.
 * @param description The description of the token.
 * @param externalUrl The external URL of the token.
 * @param image The image of the token.
 * @param backgroundColor The background color of the token.
 * @param animationUrl The animation URL of the token.
 */
struct Metadata {
    string name;
    string description;
    string externalUrl;
    string image;
    string backgroundColor;
    string animationUrl;
}
