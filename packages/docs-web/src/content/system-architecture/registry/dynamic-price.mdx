# Dynamic Price

Dynamic tokens are registered with the Dynamic Price registry. Dynamic tokens allow organizations to set stable price targets for their products and subscriptions using a volatile token such as WETH.

- Dynamic tokens are created and managed by the ProductMint team
- During a purchase, the Purchase Manager will check the registry with the pricing model token to check if it is a dynamic token
