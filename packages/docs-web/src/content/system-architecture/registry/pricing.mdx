# Pricing

Pricing models are created by organizations to determine the price of a product with a subscription.

- Multiple pricing models can be linked to a product
- Users can upgrade/downgrade their subscription to a different pricing model with a prorated cost
- Charge styles include one time, flat rate, tiered volume, tiered graduated, usage based volume, and usage based graduated

## Pricing Struct

```solidity
/**
 * @param orgId The organization ID that the pricing configuration belongs to.
 * @param chargeStyle How the product should be charged.
 * @param chargeFrequency How often the subscription is charged.
 * @param tiers The tiers of pricing used in TIER and USAGE_BASED models.
 * @param token The ERC20 token that is used for all tiers. address(0) means use the native token of the chain.
 * @param flatPrice The price of the product if the pricing model is FLAT_RATE or chargeStyle is ONE_TIME.
 * @param usageMeterId The usage meter ID that is used to record the usage of the product. 0 if not used.
 * @param isActive If true, then the pricing configuration can be used in new purchases, else it is not available for purchase.
 * @param isRestricted If true, then the pricing configuration is restricted to wallets that have been granted restricted access.
