# Permission

The permission registry is responsible for managing permission for an organization and their product pass customers. In order to charge a customer for a product or subscription, the owner must grant access to the organization.

- Only the owner of the product pass can update their own permissions
- By default, all charge permissions are granted when a customer mints an organization's product pass

## Permission Struct

```solidity
/**
 * @param id The ID of the permission. Hash of the name.
 * @param name The name of the permission. In dot notation (e.g. "pass.wallet.spend")
 * @param description The description of the permission.
 * @param isActive The active status of the permission.
 * @param createdAt The block timestamp when the permission was created.
 */
struct Permission {
    bytes32 id;
    string name;
    string description;
    bool isActive;
    uint256 createdAt;
}
