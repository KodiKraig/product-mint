# Purchase

The purchase registry is responsible for keeping track of products minted onto product passes along with additional purchase settings for an organization.

Organization admins can:
- Set whether new product passes can be minted
- Set the maximum number of product passes that can be minted
- Set the maximum supply for a product creating market scarcity
- Set whether mints are closed for an organization and no products can be purchased
