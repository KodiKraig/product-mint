### Micro-Payments

ProductMint supports micro-payments allowing you to charge small amounts with no minimums. No need to worry about flat minimum fees required by other payment processors.

## Payment Escrow

The Payment Escrow contract is used to hold funds for an organization. Whenever a product is purchased or a subscription is renewed/upgraded, the funds will be transferred to the Payment Escrow contract immediately ready for the Organization NFT holder to claim.

## Layer 1 vs Layer 2

Layer 1 chains have a higher fee structure than Layer 2 chains. This is because Layer 1 chains have a higher gas price and are more expensive to use and operate our system.

## Stablecoins

Stablecoins such as USDC have a lower fee structure than non-stablecoins. This is because stablecoins prices do not change.
